# Random diagrams
This provides a set of random diagrams built with Python [diagrams](https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/) library.

This is intended as a playground and based heavily on [diagrams' own examples](https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/docs/getting-started/examples).
Any semblance to these examples is not surprising.
Any semblance to real life systems is accidental.
